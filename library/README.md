# Library

Library task for The Odin Project.

# Features

1. Creation and modification of "book" objects
2. Saving the "library" to a Firebase realtime database when user signs in using Google

# TODO

1. Add instruction/help text
2. Add "Loading..." text so user knows their requests are being processed
3. Style changes
  a. the new book form doesn't seem to match the overall theme
  b. need to centre the new book form
  c. need to make the background inaccessible when the new book form is active, but still have it so that clicking/tapping outside the form closes it.
